    "Q1. When creating a custom exception in Python, it's essential to inherit from the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. This is because the `Exception` class provides a common interface and behavior for all exceptions in Python. By inheriting from `Exception`, your custom exception gains all the properties and methods of the base class, allowing it to be caught and handled in a consistent manner with other exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Here's a Python program to print the Python Exception Hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import builtins\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(exception_class, indent=0):\n",
    "    print(' ' * indent + exception_class.__name__)\n",
    "    for subclass in exception_class.__subclasses__():\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "print_exception_hierarchy(builtins.BaseException)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This program prints the hierarchy of Python exceptions starting from the `BaseException` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. The `ArithmeticError` class in Python defines errors related to arithmetic operations. Two common errors defined in this class are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when division or modulo operation is performed on zero.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "       print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `OverflowError`: Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 ** 1000\n",
    "   except OverflowError as e:\n",
    "       print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The `LookupError` class in Python is used as a base class for errors that occur when a key or index used on a mapping or sequence is invalid or not found. Examples of `LookupError` subclasses include `KeyError` and `IndexError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `KeyError`: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "  try:\n",
    "      value = my_dict['c']\n",
    "  except KeyError as e:\n",
    "      print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `IndexError`: Raised when a sequence index is out of range.\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  try:\n",
    "      value = my_list[3]\n",
    "  except IndexError as e:\n",
    "      print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. `ImportError` is raised when an import statement fails to find the module, or when a from ... import statement cannot find a name that is to be imported. `ModuleNotFoundError` is a subclass of `ImportError` introduced in Python 3.6, specifically raised when a module could not be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Best practices for exception handling in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be specific: Catch only the exceptions you expect and can handle.\n",
    "- Use `try`/`except` blocks judiciously: Wrap only the statements that might raise an exception.\n",
    "- Provide meaningful error messages: Help users understand what went wrong.\n",
    "- Handle exceptions at the right level: Handle exceptions closest to the point where they occur.\n",
    "- Avoid catching generic exceptions: Catching `Exception` or `BaseException` might mask critical errors.\n",
    "- Use `finally` blocks for cleanup: Ensure that resources are released regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",
    "- Avoid silent failures: Always log or report exceptions so they can be debugged.\n",
    "- Follow Python's exception hierarchy: Use built-in exceptions where appropriate and create custom exceptions when necessary."
